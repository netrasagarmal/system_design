# Low Level Design Patterns

Concept of **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** design patterns with **real-world analogies**.

---

## üß± 1. **Creational Patterns** ‚Äì *"How objects are created"*
> Focus on how objects are created, while hiding the instantiation logic and making the system independent of how its objects are created, composed, or represented.
> 

### üîë Purpose:

- Handle object creation problems.
- Promote flexibility and reuse.

### üéØ Theme: Object Creation

> Think of situations where **you don‚Äôt create something directly**, but rely on a structured way to get the object.

### ‚úÖ Key Subtypes:

| Pattern | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Singleton** | Ensures a class has **only one instance** and provides a global access point to it. |
| **Factory Method** | Lets subclasses decide which object to create ‚Äî uses **inheritance**. |
| **Abstract Factory** | Creates families of related objects **without specifying concrete classes**. |
| **Builder** | Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. |
| **Prototype** | Creates objects by **cloning** an existing instance rather than creating a new one. |
---

### üç∞ **Example 1: Bakery (Factory Pattern)**

* You don‚Äôt bake the cake yourself.
* You tell the bakery: ‚ÄúI want a chocolate cake.‚Äù
* The bakery (factory) makes the correct type and gives it to you.

**‚û°Ô∏è Code analogy:** You call `CakeFactory.createCake("chocolate")`, and it returns a `ChocolateCake` object.

---

### üßç **Example 2: President (Singleton Pattern)**

* There‚Äôs only **one president** of a country.
* You don‚Äôt "create" a new president; everyone refers to the **same person**.

**‚û°Ô∏è Code analogy:** `President.getInstance()` always returns the same object.

---

### üçî **Example 3: Burger Order (Builder Pattern)**

* You want a custom burger: add lettuce, remove onions, extra cheese.
* The builder lets you specify each step and creates the final burger.

**‚û°Ô∏è Code analogy:**

```python
BurgerBuilder().addLettuce().addCheese().removeOnion().build()
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è 2. **Structural Patterns** ‚Äì *"How objects are arranged and connected"*

> Deal with the composition of classes and objects ‚Äî i.e., how to form larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient.
> 

### üîë Purpose:

- Helps ensure that parts of a system **work together effectively**.
- Improve **code maintainability**, **scalability**, and **flexibility**.

### üéØ Theme: Object Composition

> Think of these like **engineering blueprints** for connecting parts to build a bigger system.

### ‚úÖ Key Subtypes:

| Pattern | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Adapter** | Converts the interface of one class into another expected by the client. |
| **Decorator** | Adds new functionality to objects **dynamically** without modifying their structure. |
| **Facade** | Provides a simplified **interface** to a complex subsystem. |
| **Proxy** | Acts as a placeholder or controller for accessing the real object. |
| **Composite** | Treats individual objects and groups of objects **uniformly** (tree structures). |
| **Bridge** | Decouples abstraction from implementation so that both can vary independently. |
| **Flyweight** | Reduces memory usage by **sharing common parts** of objects instead of creating new ones repeatedly. |


---

### üß© **Example 1: Lego Blocks (Composite Pattern)**

* Each block can be small or a large collection of smaller blocks.
* Together, they form a complex structure like a house or robot.

**‚û°Ô∏è Code analogy:** A `Shape` interface has both `Circle` and `GroupOfShapes`, and both can be drawn.

---

### üîå **Example 2: Power Plug Adapter (Adapter Pattern)**

* You have a UK plug, but the socket is US-style.
* You use an adapter so that incompatible systems can work together.

**‚û°Ô∏è Code analogy:** `UKPlugAdapter` converts UK plug interface to US socket interface.

---

### üì∫ **Example 3: TV Remote (Facade Pattern)**

* Remote gives **simple buttons** (power, volume) to control a **complex TV system** inside.
* You don‚Äôt deal with the wiring or signal processing.

**‚û°Ô∏è Code analogy:** `TVFacade.turnOn()` internally handles amplifier, signal input, screen, etc.

---

## ü§ù 3. **Behavioral Patterns** ‚Äì *"How objects communicate"*

> Concerned with object communication ‚Äî how they interact, communicate, and delegate responsibilities.
> 

### üîë Purpose:

- Improve **communication between objects**.
- Manage complex control flows or responsibilities.

### üéØ Theme: Object Collaboration & Interaction

> These are about **who does what**, **who talks to whom**, and **how**.

### ‚úÖ Key Subtypes:

| Pattern | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Strategy** | Selects an algorithm's behavior **at runtime** via composition. |
| **Observer** | Defines a **1-to-many dependency** where objects are notified of changes. |
| **Command** | Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing undo/redo, queuing. |
| **State** | Allows an object to **alter its behavior** when its internal state changes. |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Passes a request along a chain of handlers until one handles it. |
| **Mediator** | Centralizes complex communication between multiple objects. |
| **Template Method** | Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass, letting subclasses fill in steps. |
| **Iterator** | Provides a way to access elements of a collection without exposing its structure. |
| **Visitor** | Allows new operations to be performed on object structures **without modifying them**. |
| **Interpreter** | Defines a grammar and interpreter for a language. |


---

### üì£ **Example 1: YouTube Channel (Observer Pattern)**

* You subscribe to a channel.
* Every time a new video is uploaded, you (and all subscribers) are notified.

**‚û°Ô∏è Code analogy:**

```python
channel.subscribe(user1)
channel.notifySubscribers("New Video!")
```

---

### üí≥ **Example 2: Payment Options (Strategy Pattern)**

* At checkout, you choose UPI, Card, or Wallet.
* The app **dynamically** selects the algorithm based on your choice.

**‚û°Ô∏è Code analogy:**

```python
payment = CardPayment()
checkout.setPaymentStrategy(payment)
checkout.pay()
```

---

### üßæ **Example 3: Restaurant Waiter Orders (Command Pattern)**

* You tell the waiter: "Bring me a Veg Burger."
* The waiter doesn‚Äôt make the burger, but passes the **command** to the chef.

**‚û°Ô∏è Code analogy:**

```python
Command order = new VegBurgerCommand(kitchen)
waiter.takeOrder(order)
```
